[Simon Memory challenge](https://fatimascoding2020.github.io/Simon-Memory-Challenge/) is an simple interactive memory challenge game.

The Simon Memory Challenge is a memory game designed to engage users of all ages and is child friendly.It is a game with lights and sounds, easy to play, offers various difficulty levels to the user, in which users must replicate a sequence of lights and sounds by pressing the coloured buttons.It features a Start button to start the game sequence and Try Again button will restart the game if the user gets the sequence wrong.This game is fully responsive to the users chosen device.

I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build this and the game which will form part of my ongoing portfolio of work.

As a user:

## Design Choices

The following are the design choices:

**Fonts**

- The main body font **Press Start 2P** was chosen as it is font design from 1980s Namco arcade games.

- The fallback font is **Roboto**.

**Colours**

- The colour choices of buttons are red, blue, green and yellow similar to the original Simon Says game 

**Styling**

- Minimilistic design makes the buttons easy to see when lit. 

**Background**

- Dark mode and light mode toggling according to player choice.

**Audio files**

- Different sounds to help memory.
