## Testing Against User Stories

The below goes through of of the user stores listed in the UX section of the [README.md](https://github.com/FatimasCoding2020/Simon-Memory-Challenge/blob/main/README.md).

1. The website to be visually appealing.

    - The website has a arcade theme which appeals to the user.
    - The background can be changed to dark mode an option which was done to stimulate the visual appearance to the user.
    
2. To be able to navigate myself around the site with ease and with as little guidance as necessary.

    - All user interaction buttons are clearly labeled so the user can see it and instantly know what it does.
    - During the course of the challenge, buttons appear right of the screen that the user can interact with and use what the intent of that button does.

3. To easily access the game information if needed, and control the sounds coming from the website.

    - All buttons are easily accessible to the user.
    - The audio controls are simple the user can use the ON/OFF button to completely disable them.

4. I want to be able to choose the difficulty level of the game before I play and have an idea of what will change with each difficulty level.

    - The user has an option to choose and to confirm the difficulty they want to play at.

5. I want to be able to restart the game if necessary without having to go back to the home screen to do it.

    - This has been achieved with the “Try again” button and a instruction to try again.

## Manual Testing

I have detailed the manual testing undertaken during the development stage to ensure that all aspects of the game work as intended.

### Responsive Design Testing

During the development and testing phase of the site, I used Google Chrome Dev Tools to test the layout as I built my code and used the various screen sizes to ensure that it displayed correctly and that elements of the size displayed correctly and easily viewable by the user.

All testing was performed using:

- Google Chrome
- Opera
- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox
- Safari (on iPhone & iPad)
- Desktop 
- Mobile Phones 
- Tablets 

#### Overview

This game was intended to be responsive to all user media devices such as mobile phones, tablets, desktops.

To ensure the site and game board remains responsive, I tested the layout at every stage of development on the various screen sizes within the Chrome Dev tools and corrected the styling of the elements and added Media Queries so that the design will adjust to device being viewed.


### Additional Testing

I asked my friends and family to try the game out on their various devices and they could not find any errors within the game or the responsiveness of the site.
