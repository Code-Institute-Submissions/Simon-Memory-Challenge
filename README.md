[Simon Memory challenge](https://fatimascoding2020.github.io/Simon-Memory-Challenge/) is an simple interactive memory game.

The Simon Memory Challenge is a memory game designed to engage users of all ages and is child friendly.It is a game with lights and sounds, easy to play, offers various difficulty levels to the user, in which users must replicate a sequence of lights and sounds by pressing the coloured buttons.It features a Start button to start the game sequence and Try Again button will restart the game if the user gets the sequence wrong.This game is fully responsive to the users chosen device.

I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build this and the game which will form part of my ongoing portfolio of work.

## __UX__

### Project goals
The primary goal of Simon Memory Challenge is to provide the user with a simple and fun, easy to use interface.It has different levels of difficulty and is child-friendly.

### User goals

### User stories

As a user:

- I want the page to be visually appealing.

- I want to easily access the game, tutorial information if needed, and control the sounds coming from the website.

- I want to be easily go through difficulty levels of the game and before I play, I have an idea of what will change with each difficulty level.

- I want to be able to restart the game if necessary without having to go back to the home screen to do it.


## Design Choices

The following are the design choices:

**Fonts**

- The main body font **Press Start 2P** was chosen as it is font design from 1980s Namco arcade games.

- The fallback font is **Roboto**.

- The colour choices of buttons are red, blue, green and yellow similar to the original Simon Says game 

**Styling**

- Minimilistic design makes the buttons easy to see when lit. 

**Background**

- Dark mode and light mode toggling according to player choice.

**Audio files**

- Different sounds to help memory.
